                \begin{itemize}[nosep, leftmargin=1em, itemsep=3pt]
                   %\item[--] Using Excel and Power BI to create statistics and visualizations to analyze what could be done better in projects. What are the trouble areas and stress points? What are teams struggling with? I am working to find out what the data is telling us (analysis). Then I will create a repeatable process (monthly, quarterly, or annually). I will create a list of possible opportunities based on this data to present to change champions. I will create a feedback form or comment box for teams to leave feedback about where the issues are and the process I am creating will be how to review this feedback and to create a list to go after in the next year/quarter/etc. 
                    %\item[--] Performed data analysis of existing lessons learned data using to identify trends and opportunities for improvement; performed a read out of process opportunities based on lessons learned data; went through several iterations to determine which results were the most valuable and how to present them and to ensure the most effective and time efficient tools were used (and would be used in the go-forward process)
                    %\item[--] proposed go-forward process for lessons learned data; created a LEAN repeatable process to perform analysis of lessons learned data for regular reports biannually
                    %\item[--] Used data to initiate data driven conversations; presentations on lessons learned findings and opportunities to change champions, leadership staff meetings, and project management office; used data to highlight areas for improvement; allowed me to communicate with many different groups; expanded upon my abilities to report out, write a powerpoint presentation for leadership and for people with no prior knowledge of the project and data, learned how to take constructive criticism and work it into future iternations of a project and presentation; how to make data understandable and answer the questions "what does the data tell us" and "what is the 'so what' factor of the data"
                    %\item[--] Project managers submit lessons learned data as they close out projects. The team has been collecting this data since June 2021 and had never done a cohesive analysis of it. I used Excel as my main tool to find trends in the data, with help from Miro and Azure AI. We found that planning and vendors were the two areas with the biggest room for improvement. The biggest struggle with this project was learning how to analyze text data; I used Azure AI to parse the data in a time efficient manner along with complex, nested Excel formulas and Excel macros/VBA. After completing the analysis, I presented my findings to multiple groups of leaders & stakeholders. \\
                    %\item[--] During the process of analyzing the lessons learned data, I explored different tools and methods of analysis to propose a go-forward process for repeating the analysis on a regular basis. I went through several iterations to determine which results were the most valuable and how to achieve them in an effective and time efficient manner. I was able to create a master Excel file which is connected to the SharePoint list where the lessons learned data lives. The Excel sheet updates as the SharePoint list is updated. I proposed a biannual analysis of this data, and the Excel sheet will simply need to be refreshed with the new data and the existing analyses will update.
                    %\item[--] Read out the results and opportunities found from lessons learned analysis to the leaders and stakeholders; I used data to highlight areas for improvement. This allowed me to communicate with many different groups of people and taught me how to write/create a PowerPoint presentation for leadership and for people with no prior knowledge of the subject/data. This pushed me to think about how I can make data understandable and answer the questions "what does the data tell us?" and "what is the 'so what' factor of the data?".
                    \item[--] Skills used: Power BI, PowerPoint, Miro, Azure AI, Power Automate, SharePoint (lists), Excel (pivot tables, graphs (Paretos, Gantt charts), complex nested formulas (IF, OR, AND, SEARCH, FIND, ISNUMBER, COUNTIF, XLOOKUP), Power Query, macros/VBA)
                    \item[--] Conducted comprehensive data analysis of existing lessons learned data using Excel, Power BI, Azure AI, and Miro to identify trends and opportunities for process and project improvements
                    \item[--] Proposed a LEAN repeatable process for regular analysis of lessons learned data, resulting in biannual reports that provided valuable insights for optimizing processes and projects
                    \item[--] Determined the biggest project change reasons (PCRs) using Excel analysis of PPM data, enabling proactive measures to mitigate risks and enhance project outcomes
                    \item[--] Performed data analysis tasks as required, employing various tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights and support decision-making processes
                    \item[--] Utilized data-driven presentations to initiate and facilitate discussions on findings, opportunities, and actionable recommendations, fostering a culture of evidence-based decision-making.
